## Description
EZPassRI is a lightweight React application prototype designed to demonstrate a simple expense/receipt management interface themed for an electronic toll/payments concept. The app includes components for entering expense items, listing them, and generating a simple receipt view. It is ideal as a starting point for developers building more complex payment portals, administrative dashboards, or prototype front-ends integrating with tolling APIs. This repository focuses on clarity, modular component structure, and easy-to-follow code so contributors of varying experience levels can quickly understand and extend the project. It includes a short development setup, contribution guidelines, and componentized styling so you can fork and adapt it for real integrations or UI experiments.
